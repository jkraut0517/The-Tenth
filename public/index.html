    <section id="about">
       <div class="centered-content">
         <p>Massage therapy dates back to 15,000 BCE as evidenced by cave paintings that depict healing touch.  The practice of
           massage has evolved throughout time and place from Ancient Egypt to Greeze, from Indian Ayurvedic traditions to midwifery massage during The Dark Ages, from the birth of Swedish massage in the early 1800s to current medical and therapeutic practice.</p>
         <p>Modern massage is now known to be an important component of recovery from chronic pain and acute injury, as well as a tool to increase one's mind-body connection. Modern massage therapy can be defined as structured therapeutic touch involving manual soft tissue manipulation in order to restore homeostasis within the mind-body connection. While the practitioner provides healing touch, it is the communication between the practitioner and client's constitution that allows the individual's own body to heal itself.</p>
         <p>For those in the Seattle area seeking professional massage therapy, <em>The Tenth Massage and Wellness</em> is an excellent choice. Gigi Cunningham's training, professionalism, wisdom, and experience make her uniquely qualified to devise massage treatments appropriate for each client's situation.</p>
